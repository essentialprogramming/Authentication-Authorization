# Authentication & Authorization

To know what a user can do, you first need to know who the user is. This is known as authentication. It is often done by asking for a set of credentials, such as username & password. Once verified, the client gets information about the identity and access of the user. Authorization in system security is the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function.
